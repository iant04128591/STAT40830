# Introduction

`geegeer` is a `R` package that implements various models to predict the probability that a given horse in a given race will win.
The package scrapes racecard/result information off [sporting.com](http://www.sportinglife.com/racing).


# API

The public funtions in the package are:

  * listRaces
  
  * listHorses
  
  * predictProbabilities 
  
  * compareModelVSp




# listRaces - track date

This function lists the races  

# listHorses - raceId

# predictRaceProbabilities - returns horse name / decimal odds

# compareModelVSp - compares the predicted model probabilities v the offical sp for that a runner 

#Remarks

The package can be used to compare the probabilities from the various statistical models versus the offical SP and
