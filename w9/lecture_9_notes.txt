Lecture 9 - Shiny!

Resources:
http://shiny.rstudio.com/
http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/ - pretty good tutorial
http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/ - really useful gallery
https://www.r-bloggers.com/supplementing-your-r-package-with-a-shiny-app-2/ - including shiny in an R package

1) Go to File > New > Shiny Web App
Talk through application
(Also in app_1.R

2) Talk through app_2.R

3) Go to gallery and talk through
Also read the tutorial
Talking about forking from github

4) Design a Shiny web app for climr

- Sidebar contains:
	- a picker for NH, SH, or Global.
	- a picker for smoother type lm, loess, or spline
	- a picker for data type, yearly, quarterly, monthly
	- a picker for choice of time grid
- Main panel contains plot of data

5) Steps to include the Shiny app in a package

a)
library(devtools)
use_package('shiny')
b)
Move your package directory into inst / shiny-examples / app
Separate into ui.R and server.R (if not done already)
c) Add an climr_shiny.R file in your R folder containing:
climr_shiny = function() {
  appDir = system.file("shiny-examples", 'app', package = 'climr')
  if (appDir == "") {
    stop("Could not find shiny directory in package. Try re-installing `climr`.", call. = FALSE)
  }

  shiny::runApp(appDir, display.mode = "normal")
}
Add in rOxygen documentation
d) Check and build your package
e) Run your Shiny example with
climr_shiny()

Homework:
Design a Shiny app for your package (designed in week 6 and coded (at least partially in week 8))
