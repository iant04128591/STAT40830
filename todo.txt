## EXERCISE

1. Design a package. 
----------------------------------------
You should come up with a name and a rough description for it, and a description of the R functions that will go in it. 
The package can do anything you like: analyse data, produce graphs, perform some kind of fancy model, but it shouldn't 
have more than 5-6 functions. You don't have to write any code! You should merely produce a max 3 page pdf document which 
gives your function name and a description of what it does, and a description of what each of the functions do. In later 
weeks we'll start creating this package so make sure it's viable.

2. Code package. 
Write R code for your package

3. Vignette. 
Write a vignette to go with it

4. Shiny integration
Shiny app for your package (designed in week 6 and coded (at least partially in week 8))




Week 11 notes
This is project week. You should use this week to catch up on exercises you havenâ€™t yet completed.

By the end of week 13, you need to submit an R package in the form of a *.tar.gz file produced by devtools::build. It should be submitted to the Project assignment box on Blackboard.

It should have:
At least 4 substantial R functions
ROxygen help documentation including examples for at least two of the functions
A vignette which explains the use of the package in an informative way. See https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html for an example of a good vignette.
A Shiny app which demonstrates some functionality of the package. 
Hopefully some of the above you have already completed during the weekly exercises. In week 6 you should have designed the package, in week 8 written R code and drafted a vignette, and in week 9 designed/written a Shiny app.  

I will mark the package by doing the following:
Downloading the R package and running devtools::check on it. You will receive 5/5 for no errors/warnings/notes, with -2 for each error, and -1 for each note/warning.
Reading the DESCRIPTION file. This should be informative and concise. Marked out of 5
Installing the package and running the examples. Marked out of 5
Running the Shiny app. Marked out of 5
Reading the vignette and running the associated commands. Marked out of 10. 
Total: 30 marks
